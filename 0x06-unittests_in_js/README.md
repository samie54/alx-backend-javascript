Project: Unittests in JS
Author: Samuel Atiemo

Project Tasks:

0. Basic test with Mocha and Node assertion library
mandatory

1. Combining descriptions
mandatory
Create a new file named 1-calcul.js:

2. Basic test using Chai assertion library
mandatory
While using Node assert library is completely valid, a lot of developers prefer to have a behavior driven development style.

3. Spies
mandatory
Spies are a useful wrapper that will execute the wrapped function, and log useful information (e.g. was it called, with what arguments).

4. Stubs
mandatory
Stubs are similar to spies. Except that you can provide a different implementation of the function you are wrapping. Sinon can be used as well for stubs.

5. Hooks
mandatory
Hooks are useful functions that can be called before execute one or all tests in a suite

6. Async tests with done
mandatory
Look into how to support async testing, for example when waiting for the answer of an API or from a Promise

7. Skip
mandatory
When you have a long list of tests, and you canâ€™t figure out why a test is breaking, avoid commenting out a test, or removing it

8. Basic Integration testing
mandatory
In a folder 8-api located at the root of the project directory, copy this package.json over.

9. Regex integration testing
mandatory
In a folder 9-api, reusing the previous project in 8-api (package.json, api.js and api.test.js)

10. Deep equality & Post integration testing
mandatory
In a folder 10-api, reusing the previous project in 9-api (package.json, api.js and api.test.js)
